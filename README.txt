KENAI NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE SPECIES LIST


Summary

This repository exists for cataloging species known to be present on the
Kenai National Wildlife Refuge.

The Kenai National Wildlife Refugeâ€™s species list was previously
maintained as a set of data tables from which a checklist document was
generated (Kenai National Wildlife Refuge biology staff 2018). In April
2019, most of these data were uploaded to FWSpecies (U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service- Natural Resource Program Center 2019), where these
data are currently maintained.

The directory structure of this archive is being conformed to the
recommended file structure of Alaska Region Data Stewardship Team
(2019).
