# Kenai National Wildlife Refuge Species List

## Summary

This repository exists for cataloging species known to be present on the
[Kenai National Wildlife
Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/kenai/ "Kenai National Wildlife Refuge").

The Kenai National Wildlife Refugeâ€™s species list was previously
maintained as a set of data tables from which a checklist document was
generated (Kenai National Wildlife Refuge biology staff
[2018](#ref-KenaiNWRbio2018)). In April 2019, most of these data were
uploaded to FWSpecies (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Natural Resource
Program Center [2019](#ref-NRPC2019)), where these data are currently
maintained.

The directory structure of this archive is being conformed to the
recommended file structure of Alaska Region Data Stewardship Team
([2019](#ref-Alaska_Region_Data_Stewardship_Team_2020)).
