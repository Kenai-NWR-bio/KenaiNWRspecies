## Kenai National Wildlife Refuge Species List

This repository exists for cataloging species known to be present on the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge. 

It will also be used for publishing scripts for extracting and converting data from [FWSpecies](https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/DownloadFile/163859 "FWSpecies User Guide Version 2.0") checklists which may also be useful for processing data from other National Wildlife Refuges' species lists.
