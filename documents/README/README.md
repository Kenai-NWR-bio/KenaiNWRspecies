# Kenai National Wildlife Refuge Species List

## Summary

This repository exists for cataloging species known to be present on the [Kenai National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/kenai/ "Kenai National Wildlife Refuge").

The Kenai National Wildlife Refuge's species list was previously maintained as a set of data tables from which a checklist document was generated [@KenaiNWRbio2018]. In April 2019, most of these data were uploaded to FWSpecies [@NRPC2019], where these data are currently maintained.  

The directory structure of this archive is being conformed to the recommended file structure of @Alaska_Region_Data_Stewardship_Team_2020.
